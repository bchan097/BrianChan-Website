        <p class="lead mb-4">A first year Pre-Business undergraduate student at University of California, Riverside with an interest in Finance and Information Systems.<br><br>

        <br>
My current experience is limited with the ongoing pandemic. In late 2019, I was a student intern at FACES For the Future at Alameda Hospital located in CA. While working as a student intern, I was able to explore the different medical fields in search of future interests while learning professional work ethics. I began monitoring and gauging patientâ€™s blood pressure to ensure healthy and normal levels while supporting the Director of Nursing with small tasks. When the lockdown hit, I was unable to be a student intern due to safety precautions.
<br><br>

With limited experience, I decided to create a freelance car-detailing business with a fellow business friend with my knowledge and experience on professional detailing. From August of 2020 to the present, our small team of two was able to create a solid foundation for our business that continues to grow as we actively search for improvements to our work. With little to no knowledge on professional work (pricing, websites, advertising, etc.) I forced myself to learn and create from others. From the ground up, I created a minimal, yet professional website. Me and my partner put ourselves out into our community and searched for others with experience in the car-detailing industry to learn more about helpful advice and find critiques on our website.
<br><br>

As our business began to grow, I began to create my own professional mindset to work with. I promoted our different levels of services by creating displays on our website with eye-drawing information to hook new customers. As we continued to grow, I began forcing my professional mindset to my fellow partner. I maintained high-standards of professionalism along with our service quality by reviewing customer feedback, overseeing work looking for improvement, and handling any situations with customers without negativity. With the addition of a new team member, I set and enforced performance and service standards that met certain quality standards to keep consistent, high-quality services to ensure customer satisfaction, even if it takes extra time and effort.
<br><br>

Although I am nowhere near the standards that I would like, I continue to put myself out there to obtain and learn more information that will help me in the future with professional work experience and ethics.
